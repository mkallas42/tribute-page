    <h1>User story</h1>
    <p>In software development and product management, a <b>user story</b> is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software[1] Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development team members.
    User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.</p>
