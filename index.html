    <h1 id="title">User story</h1>
    <div>
    <p>In software development and product management, a <b>user story</b> is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software[1] Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users, managers, or development team members.
    User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; that is, they help software teams organize their understanding of the system and its context.</p>

<h2 id="title">History</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1998</strong>: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong>: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP),[4] and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
        <li><strong>2001</strong>: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:[5]</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;</li>
            <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
            <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>2004</strong>: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development[6] that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.[7]</li>
        <li><strong>2014</strong>: After a first article in 2005[8] and a blog post in 2008,[9] in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.[10]</li>

<h2 id="title">Principle</h2>
<p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.</p>

<h2 id="title">Usage</h2>
<p>As a central part of many agile development methodologies, such as in XP's planning game, user stories describe what may be built in the software project. User stories are prioritized by the customer (or the product owner in Scrum) to indicate which are most important for the system and will be broken down into tasks and estimated by the developers. One way of estimating is via a Fibonacci scale.</p>
<p>When user stories are about to be implemented, the developers should have the possibility to talk to the customer about it. The short stories may be difficult to interpret, may require some background knowledge or the requirements may have changed since the story was written.</p>
<p>User stories can be expanded to add detail based on these conversations. This can include notes, attachments and acceptance criteria.</p>

<h2 id="title">Benefits</h2>
<p>There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which is linked to success.[19]</p>
